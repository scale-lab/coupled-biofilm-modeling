- **three_biofilm_analysis_fast.csv** uses nearest neighbor Kuramoto coupling model as our extrapolation but only on time vector length of 500 with 300 points. I found this to be lacking in that some parts of the diff equations had not reached steady state yet. but it ran quickly (approximately 3 hours) 
- **three_biofilm_analysis_slower.csv** uses all the same information and method as above, but now with time vector length of 1000 with 1000 points which means that in all cases (unless I have not seen them), end is in steady state and we have more points meaning more accurate predictions. 
- **three_biofilm_gates.csv** uses the three_biofilm_analysis_slower.csv and passes that through three_biofilm_csv_analysis.py which produces this .csv documenting different gates given a particular arrangement of g, k, and delta (glutamate concentration, communication strength, and competition strength respectively). Note that this uses only the phase difference between 1, 2 rather than the phase difference between all of them to determine if something is out of phase or in phase. In addition, we assign some threshold number which we call in phase or out of phase (in this case it is 1 radian right now but that can be easily changed)
