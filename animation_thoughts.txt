Just like with the two biofilm system, there seems to be a concentration threshold in which
we are able to see two different patterns within the biofilms

// This is only for quick transient solutions rather than looking purely at the steady state. It also
// does not seem like this is an end all be all answer to the question.

IF LOW CONCENTRATION OF GLUTAMATE:
	- If they are already out of sync, they will stay out of sync (or at least that is what the simulations show)
 	  This is only to a certain extent and if within some threshold, they can still switch
	- If already in sync, they will stay in sync.
	- Basically, they will just take on whatever old value that they have.


IF HIGH CONCENTRATION OF GLUTAMATE:
	- If in sync, will go in sync
	- If out of sync, will go in sync with each other

Now, if above or below some threshold by a certain margin, the greater or lesser the concentration of glutamate,
the quicker they get to that position.
